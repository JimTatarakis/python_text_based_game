Imports:

The necessary functions and classes are imported for handling game logic, character stats, equipment, and monsters.

Loading Data:

JSON files are read into variables for armor, weapons, monsters, boss monsters, mage skills, and the mage character using read_json_file.
These data are then passed into their respective manager classes (Armor, Weapon, Monster, BossMonster, SkillManager, Mage)
for easier access and manipulation during gameplay.
Introductory Scene:

The game starts with a text-based introduction.
slow_print is used to display the introduction with a small delay between each character for a dramatic effect.

Main Loop: The game continuously runs until the player chooses to exit or dies. It starts by entering a room, handling possible monster encounters,
and progressing through combat or other actions (chest opening, character management).

Monster & Mage Combat: Combat alternates between the monster and the mage.
The mage can attack, use skills, or manage resources like health and mana.

Skill Management: Skills can be used to influence combat, such as using double-cast or damage immunity.

Loot & Rewards: After defeating a monster, the player can receive experience points, gold, and potentially items (armor, weapons, or skill cards).

Character Management: The mage can view their stats, inventory, equip items, and upgrade skills and stats.
